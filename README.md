```lrc
[00:04.76] A flock across my window
[00:07.25] Gone when I look around
[00:10.63] Until the sun gets longer
[00:13.95] They're getting out of town
[00:16.74] Where on earth in the world
[00:19.51] Do they go?
[00:21.76] Do their feathers freeze stiff
[00:26.87] In the snow?
[00:28.71] How should I know?
[00:37.71] 
[00:31.38] But I can bet you they'll come
[00:34.05] Back to the same old tree
[00:37.42] Since I was crawling they've been
[00:40.43] Watching over me
[00:43.01] In the gardens
[00:46.37] That ripple in the water
[00:48.99] Climbing higher up
[00:51.89] Where nobody sees
[00:57.49] Look at the sky and spot the green
[01:14.49] 
[01:13.02] And I heard that they weren't
[01:16.23] Meant to stay
[01:18.58] Anywhere the air chokes
[01:23.05] Or they get
[01:24.84] On the flyway
[01:31.34] 
[01:31.20] So ride the rising currents
[01:35.19] I trust that I will see you again
[01:38.22] When I pick up the courage
[01:41.28] I hope that I can join you someday
